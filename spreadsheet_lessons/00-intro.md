## Introduction

Spreadsheet programs are very useful graphical interfaces for designing data tables and handling basic data quality control functions. 

**Question:** How many people have used or are using spreadsheets in their research?

### Spreadsheet programs

- Microsoft Excel
- Google Sheets
- Numbers

Commands may differ a bit between programs, but general ideas
for thinking about spreadsheets are the same.

Spreadsheets encompass a lot of the things we need
to be able to do as researchers. We can use them for:

- Data entry
- Organizing data
- Subsetting and sorting data
- Statistics
- Plotting
- and more.

Spreadsheets can be very useful, but they can also be
frustrating and can sometimes give us incorrect results.

**Question:** What are some things that you've accidentally done in
a spreadsheet, or have been frustrated that you can't do
easily?

### Spreadsheet outline

In this lesson we’re going to talk about how to organize spreadsheets to keep data clean and reusable, we're not going to go through the built-in functions available in most spreadsheet software.  Specific topics we will cover include:

- Good data entry practices - formatting data tables in spreadsheets
- How to avoid common formatting mistakes
- Dates as data
- Basic quality control and data manipulation in spreadsheets
- Exporting data from spreadsheets

The **cardinal rules** of using spreadsheet programs with research data:

	1. Put all your variables in columns.
	2. Put each observation in its own row.
	3. Leave the raw data raw - don’t mess with it!
	4. Export to a text based format like CSV before sharing with another program.

In reality, though, many researchers use spreadsheet programs for much more 
than this. We use them to create data tables for publications, to generate 
summary statistics, and make figures. 

In this lesson, we will assume that you are most likely using Excel as your 
primary spreadsheet program, but, again, this really doesn't matter for what we will be doing today so use any spreadsheet program you are comfortable with.
