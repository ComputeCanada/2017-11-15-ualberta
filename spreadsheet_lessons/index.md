# Data Organization in Spreadsheets

Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills,
and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less
time, and with less pain. This lesson was designed for those interested 
in working with data in environments where they expect to do at least some analysis or data presentation with other tools such as Python or R.  The emphasis is thus on making the data reusable via good practices of data entry.
